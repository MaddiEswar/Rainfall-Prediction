      <h2 style="height: 20px; ">About Rainfall Prediction</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">
        Ghana has been classified into four main ecological zones by the Ghana Meteorological Agency: Coastal, Forest, Transition, and Savannah zones. These zones are defined based on distinct climate conditions, including factors such as temperature, rainfall patterns, vegetation, and soil types. Each zone has its own unique characteristics and ecosystems, which influence agricultural practices, biodiversity, and human settlements in those regions.
        <br><br>Each ecological zone in Ghana experiences specific climate conditions that distinguish it from the others. For example:

        The Coastal zone, located along the coast of Ghana, typically has a maritime climate with relatively high humidity and moderate temperatures influenced by the ocean.
        The Forest zone, characterized by dense tropical rainforests, experiences high rainfall throughout the year and relatively stable temperatures.
        The Transition zone lies between the Forest and Savannah zones and exhibits a mix of characteristics from both regions, including varying levels of rainfall and vegetation.
        The Savannah zone, located in the northern part of Ghana, has a drier climate with distinct wet and dry seasons, where rainfall is more limited compared to the southern regions.
        <br><br>Ghana experiences two main rainfall regimes as a result of the Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD), which is the boundary between the moist southwesterly winds and the dry northeasterly trade winds. These rainfall regimes include:

        The Southward-moving Rainy Season: During this season, the ITD moves southward, bringing heavy rainfall to the southern regions of Ghana, including the Coastal and Forest zones. This period typically occurs between April and October.
        The Northward-moving Dry Season: As the ITD moves northward, the dry northeasterly winds prevail over Ghana, leading to a decrease in rainfall in the southern regions. This dry season usually occurs between November and March.
        <br><br><br>
        To predict rainfall in Ghana, a Voting Regressor model has been employed. This model is a combination of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). By combining the strengths of these algorithms, the Voting Regressor model aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of rainfall predictions. It leverages historical rainfall data, weather patterns, and other relevant factors to generate forecasts for future rainfall events, thereby assisting individuals, organizations, and policymakers in making informed decisions related to agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
